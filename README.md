## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

**1.** Problem: Restaurants want to generate more revenue with a bigger order size and more frequent repeated orders either through dine in or online ordering

**2.** Problem: Diners want to discover new dishes that suits their taste in existing brands or know what to order in new restaurant establishments

**3.** Problem: During the covid 19, restaurant wants to switch to contactless menu to protect their customers and employees.

**4.** Solution: We provide personalised digital menu based on diner profiles that restaurants can use in-store or online

**5.** How we do it: We recommend complementary dishes to diners based on user-item collaborative filtering.We recommend similar taste profile dishes based on graph association.

**6.** We can also do cross restaurants recommendations so that complementary stores can increase revenue together

**7.** Competitors:
**a.** Marketplaces like Grab Food and FoodPanda - their goal is to sell food to diners at the expense of restaurants by promoting those restaurants who can give them the biggest revenue. Most often, restaurants are making a lose in every order that goes through marketplace and their also do not know who their customers are as customers are wall fenced by these marketplaces
**b.** Ecommerce such as Oddle and TabSquare - they often do not provide recommendations out-of-the box. Foods are curated by restaurants
**c.** Speciality recommendation platform like Optimizely and DynamicYield - Their recommendation engine requires high degree of setup and their costing are out of reach for regular restaurants
